<h1>Personal Statement:Kevin Lo</h1>
<a href="all_quotes_linked.html"title="Class Quotes">Class Quotes</a>
<h2>My Background</h2>
<p>I am currently enrolled as an IT student in the Wood's College, and currently working as a supervisor at Boston College. I have worked with coding before, and am proficient with HTML, CSS and Javascript.</p>
<h2>My Interest in Web Developement</h2>
<p>I have interests in web developement because I enjoy learning how things tick, and this is the very basic bare bones level one can get when learning about how computers work at least program wise.</p>
<h2>My Extra-curricular interests, sports or hobbies</h2>
<p>I have pretty big interests in gaming, art, and cosplay. All three of these meld together very well allowing me to have one huge imagination, and pushing the limits on what I can create with my two hands. I enjoy bringing the imaginary to real life.</p>
<h2>Course Goals</h2>
<p>My course goals are pretty basic, I would like to turn in all my assignments on time, and I hope that all my current knowledge will aid me in the ability on passing all the finals and quizzes.</p>
<h2>Topic Ideas I would like to learn or discuss</h2>
<p>I would like to be able to break down how the internet works simple enough that I can explain it so my parents can understand how it works.</p>
