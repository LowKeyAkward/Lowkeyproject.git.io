      <h1>My Radical Music Review </h1>
      <h2>Amalee Nostalgia</h2>
      <p>I have only seen a few of the series that this album has theme covers on. That didn't matter while listening to it though. Amalee's voice is so beautiful and the songs themselves have such good melodies that I have already listened to this multiple times. The only track that needs any sort of knowledge of the source beforehand is the Pokemon theme- all of the others can be listened to and enjoyed without knowing anything about the show they were attached too.
This is a beautiful album and highly recommended.</p>
