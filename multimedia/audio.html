  <p>Hi! Welcome to my quick little review of Tokyo Ghoul: Re Season 2! In my opinion Tokyo Ghoul: Re in general is a sad shell of its former self. I loved the original Tokyo Ghoul but this sequel is a far cry from what it used to be. Everyone I who asks me about this anime, I will respond telling them that the manga itself already felt very rushed, but somehow they are rushing the anime even more. They tend to jump cut from scene to scene, instead of elaborating on the beautiful world they have already created. I can already tell that this was not the author's intention, but rather the studio producing the shows fault.</p>
